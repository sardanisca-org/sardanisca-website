## Synopsis

The genesis of the project "No Lodo" (In the Mud) was the discovery of family albums in slide format, submerged in mud after two flash floods. The speed with which the narratives present in the slides were lost was surprising and raised many questions: What do we do with these images now? The destruction created other images with new possibilities for reading and interpretation, but what are we really talking about when we speak of "destruction as creation" or "found object (ready-made)"? What relationship exists between these and our lives, or our habits in an increasingly digital but also increasingly disposable society? Can everything disappear in an instant? What is the place of our history and our memories? At a time when our collective memory is at such risk of being subverted, this is a project that makes us reflect. It is an artistic project but also an object of reflection. We understand that "No Lodo" meets the purpose of questioning and, in doing so, stimulating debate, critical thinking and, consequently, more active participation in society.

From these partially or totally corrupted images, Graça Santos and João Godinho develop a curation and editing work of the found material, proposing new visual and sound narratives that result in the publication of a photographic image book and the creation of a Radio-Art Performance, both entitled "No Lodo", thus exploring the balance between image-narrative and image-material, and their correspondence in the sound dimension, narrative-sound and material-sound.

The residency at Sardanisca will be a time to reflect on these questions, look at the slides slowly and re-organize them into various narrative and artistic possibilities.

In the future, we intend to bring the "No Lodo" project back to Sardanisca, in the format of creative workshops around the ideas of "Destruction as a creation tool" and "Found object / Ready made", through the use of material from local photographic archives found in different formats, working on their narrative and plastic aspects, but also with other proposals after the launch of the book and the Radio-Art performance.
