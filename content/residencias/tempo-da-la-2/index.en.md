## Proposal

- Research and material collection. Participation in shearings, collection, treatment, cataloguing and storage of wool.
- Identification of sheep and wool and implementation of good practices.
- Exploration of wool treatment techniques, from unfolding to storage and washing.
- Research and collection of local stories and knowledge, integrating oral memory and territory. In parallel, there is research and listening work: collecting stories linked to wool, people and territory, so that the project is not just technical, but human.
- Creation of materials, objects and visual supports, culminating in public presentations (exhibition/installation/open workshops), adaptable to cultural and school facilities or public spaces. The project generates physical and visual materials that remain beyond the workshops — posters, guides and objects that teach and document the process.

## Contribution

Workshops and co-creation processes, open to the community, focused on manual wool work. These will be practical learning spaces where the public follows the entire journey of wool, understanding the material, the mistakes, the time and care required.
