## Synopsis

This project was born with the purpose of valuing wool through know-how, memory and sharing.

Wool time was an artistic residency held at the Sardanisca cultural centre, 3km from Azaruja, in Alentejo, where wool was investigated as matter, memory and situated cultural practice. Sardanisca was the ideal place for this residency, where sheep and pastoral life are present and involve us. Through contacts with local shepherds, it was possible to participate in and document a shearing, allowing the direct collection of wool. It was possible to identify the wool and the errors and practices to avoid in shearing in order to improve, not only so as not to compromise the quality of the wool, but also to help the shepherd, shearer and animal welfare.

The collected wool was then treated, catalogued and part was stored with the aim of being used in future residencies and artistic projects.
Here, it was possible to explore wool treatment techniques, from unfolding to storage and washing, as well as carding and spinning. The conditions were excellent where all necessary materials were made available.

Then, with the slowness that the place encourages, it was possible to reflect, look at and feel this precious material and explore new artistic possibilities.

In the future we intend to return to Sardanisca to hold local workshops, in schools and other community centres, showing the process from sheep to yarn; as well as promoting wool as a suitable material for plastic and manual arts projects for all artists.

This project aims to contribute to the preservation and transmission of an ancestral art that is disappearing in Portugal, promoting dialogue and intersection between artistic practice, traditional knowledge, education and cultural and environmental ecology.

Slowness is assumed as methodology and ethics, in respect for the time of the material, learning, valuing listening and dialogue with sustainable practices and with the cultural heritage of Alentejo.

## Present and future artistic objectives

- Value wool as an artistic, cultural and ecological material
- Safeguard and transmit artisan knowledge linked to the territory of Alentejo – Azaruja
- Promote collaborative creation between artists, artisans and community
- Contribute to a contemporary reflection on sustainability, time and making
