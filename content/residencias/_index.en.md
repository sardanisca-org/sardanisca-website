title: "Artistic Residencies"
---
Residents can enjoy the calm of the Alentejo montado, surrounded by sheep and other animals, in an environment that provides the tranquillity and peace necessary for their work. Here, slowness is imperative.

Contributing to enriching the local culture is an important part of Sardanisca's mission. As such, all residencies should contribute to the local community, with an event or in some other suitable way.
