## Sustainability

We take sustainability and biodiversity seriously and have implemented a series of measures in this regard:

- We have installed a solar energy production system with battery storage
- We have created swales to retain rainwater for soil irrigation
- We consume water from the well, made potable through a water treatment system
- Our vegetable garden and orchard produce part of the food we eat
- Our olive oil comes from our olive trees
- Grass maintenance is carried out by a flock of sheep
- We compost all organic waste
- We are implementing a set of Permaculture initiatives (proposed by Landscape Architect João Jorge)
